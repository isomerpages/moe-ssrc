<h3><strong>Social Science and Humanities Research Fellowship</strong></h3>
<p>The Social Science and Humanities Research (SSHR) Fellowship was established
by the Social Science Research Council (SSRC) as part of its efforts to
nurture local talents and strengthen the social science and humanities
research ecosystem in Singapore.</p>
<p>As SSRC’s first talent development scheme, the SSHR Fellowship aims to
support promising Singaporean social science and humanities researchers
in the early stages of their academic careers in our Autonomous Universities.
The grant also seeks to help build their expertise and careers as researchers.</p>
<p>The SSHR Fellowship is a welcome addition to the Ministry of Education
(MOE)’s scholarship and grant ecosystem which includes the Singapore Teaching
and Academic Research Talent (START) scheme. Awardees of the SSHR Fellowship
will receive a research grant of up to S$1m over five years for any research
project in any social sciences and humanities discipline.</p>
