### **Social Science and Humanities Research Fellowship**
The Social Science and Humanities Research (SSHR) Fellowship was established by the Social Science Research Council (SSRC) as part of its efforts to nurture local talents and strengthen the social science and humanities research ecosystem in Singapore.  
  
As SSRC’s first talent development scheme, the SSHR Fellowship aims to support promising Singaporean social science and humanities researchers in the early stages of their academic careers in our Autonomous Universities. The grant also seeks to help build their expertise and careers as researchers.  
  
The SSHR Fellowship is a welcome addition to the Ministry of Education (MOE)’s scholarship and grant ecosystem which includes the Singapore Teaching and Academic Research Talent (START) scheme. Awardees of the SSHR Fellowship will receive a research grant of up to S$1m over five years for any research project in any social sciences and humanities discipline.
