While there has been significant research on the rising global challenge of deliberate online falsehoods (DOFs), information gaps remain. This project seeks to examine factors that facilitate the spread of DOFs and understand

(i) how different stakeholders define DOFs;

(ii) how social media users in Singapore determine specific DOFs; and

(iii) how social media users in Singapore deal with DOFs.

This study will also develop a news media literacy curriculum for use in Singapore. This curriculum will identify key literacies needed to teach students how to responsibly and knowledgeably deal with DOFs.
