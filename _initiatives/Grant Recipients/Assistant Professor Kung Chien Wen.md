The research project will explore how Singapore’s domestic Chinese agenda from around 1976 to 1990 shaped and was shaped by social and cultural ties between ordinary Chinese Singaporeans and both the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and the Republic of China (ROC) on Taiwan.  

The research will contribute to scholarship on international and global history in the 20th century, writing recent history from the perspective of ordinary Chinese Singaporeans for whom language and culture facilitated mobility and identity-making beyond borders.  

Insights from the research will enable a better understanding of how memories and experiences of a generation of Chinese Singaporeans continue to inform their identities and affinities today.
