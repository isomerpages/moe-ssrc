### **Social Science Research Council Graduate Research Fellowship**
1\. The terms of the SSRC GRF are as follows:  
  
a) Tenable for a period of two years;  
  
b) Tenable for research in any social science and humanities discipline, although research on local issues of relevance is encouraged;  
  
c) Two categories of award: (A) Up to SGD 10,000 per award for doctoral students and (B) SGD 20,000 per award for postdoctoral fellows. The award may be used for travel or other research-related expenses;  
  
d) Awardees will be assigned a mentor who is an experienced researcher in local Autonomous Universities (AUs)^ based on their proposed area of research, who can provide access to valuable academic and career guidance;

e) Awardees will be required to return to Singapore at least once during the tenure of award to participate in engagement activities (e.g. research seminars) within the AU and with SSRC members; and  
  
f) Awardees must comply with reporting requirements stipulated by the host AU. 

^_The participating AUs are Nanyang Technological University, National University of Singapore, Singapore Management University and Singapore University of Technology & Design._

2\. The SSRC GRF is bond-free, and host AUs are not obliged to hire GRF awardees as faculty members beyond the GRF tenure.  
  
3\. Prospective SSRC GRF awardees may only accept one GRF offer from one host AU at any point in time.  

4\. SSRC GRF recipients may reapply for a second award after the term of their first award has been completed. However, an individual will be limited to a maximum of 2 awards in total throughout their career (regardless of category). All applications for the GRF award will compete on an equal basis.

5\. SSRC GRF recipients will inform MOE and the AU should they receive other scholarships from the Singapore Government post-award for review. MOE will assess on a case-by-case basis if the GRF may run concurrently with the other scholarship.

6\. SSRC GRF applicants in the last year of their PhD programme may be offered conditional awards should they have an offer for a suitable postdoctoral position which they would assume upon graduation. Holders of conditional awards will inform MOE and the AU should there be any changes to the pre-agreed postdoctoral training plans, for review.

7\. SSRC GRF applicants who have yet to secure a PhD programme or postdoctoral position may be offered in-principle awards by the AUs. The fellowship will only be confirmed when applicants have secured a place in the pre-agreed PhD programme or postdoctoral position. Applicants should update the AUs on their application status and provide supporting documentation by the acceptance deadline.
