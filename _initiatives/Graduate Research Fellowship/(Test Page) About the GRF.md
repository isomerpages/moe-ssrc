<h3><strong>Social Science Research Council Graduate Research Fellowship</strong></h3>
<p>The Social Science Research Council (SSRC) Graduate Research Fellowship
(GRF) is a national scheme that aims to facilitate the engagement of outstanding
early-career Singaporean social science and humanities researchers who
have been accepted for their doctoral or postdoctoral training at leading
overseas research or academic institutions.</p>
<p>The SSRC GRF aims to forge strong professional networks with promising
early-career Singaporean social science and humanities researchers. This
broadened network of Singaporean researchers based both locally and abroad
facilitates a rich exchange of ideas between local and international scholars
that strengthens Singapore’s research capabilities.</p>
<p>The SSRC GRF also aims to assist in the development of promising overseas-based
early-career researchers with the provision of a small research grant and
an opportunity to be mentored by an experienced researcher in the local
Autonomous Universities (AUs). This will broaden the potential pipeline
of Singaporean researchers who may eventually take up appointments within
the local research ecosystem.</p>
