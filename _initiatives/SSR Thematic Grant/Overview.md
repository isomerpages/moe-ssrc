### **Social Science Research Thematic Grant**
The Social Science Research Thematic Grant (SSRTG) is the first major initiative by the Social Science Research Council (SSRC) aimed at boosting research in areas of strategic relevance to Singapore and Asia.  
  
Launched in May 2016, SSRTG is also the first major grant dedicated to supporting social science and humanities research in Singapore. For a start, the Ministry of Education (MOE) has set aside S$50m for the SSRTG from 2016 to 2020.  
  
Three tiers of funding are available:

**Type A: S$100,000 to S$1m for up to 3 years**<br>
For smaller-scale investigator-led research in areas of strategic relevance to encourage broader-based research participation in areas of thematic interest

**Type B: >S$1m to S$5m over 3 – 5 years**

**Type C: >S$5m to S$10m over 3 – 5 years**

For larger-scale research where research performers are encouraged to collaborate to pursue more ambitious inter-disciplinary research on issues of cross-cutting interests
