The aim of this research is to improve the integration of Augmented Reality (AR) with subject teaching via supporting teaching involvement in technology-enhanced learning design.

The project will culminate in the development of a collaborative platform, which will integrate resources that help teachers to instantiate their learning design using AR, establish a roadmap of professional development on leveraging emerging technologies into teaching, as well as explore design principles and instructional strategies of AR-enabled learning that improve students’ learning performances by taking accounts of characteristics of subject teaching.

Insights generated from this project will support pedagogical innovation and integration of AR in various subject areas, and an understanding of the pedagogical affordances of AR across different learning contexts which can enhance students’ learning outcomes.
