Health research requires a large amount of individual data to produce significant results. Translating the results into effective health interventions requires the data and analysis to be shared to accelerate innovation and avoid duplicative work. Hence, a sound governance structure for data sharing is needed to protect data providers and promote public trust. 

This project seeks to address the ethical challenges faced in data sharing in a national survey, stakeholder workshops and citizens’ juries. Results from this project will inform the generation of a trustworthy governance model for health-related data-sharing in Singapore. This will help promote cutting-edge health research and will be of interest to scholars and policymakers locally and internationally.
