The project seeks to trace and explain the strategic alignments − past, present, and future − of the ten ASEAN countries − in the wake of US-China geopolitical rivalry. As the rivalry intensifies, the uncommitted ASEAN countries will find it increasingly difficult to maintain their position of not choosing between the two superpowers. The project will seek to answer four key questions related to this strategic dilemma.  What does it mean to choose (between the US and China)?  How can we track the shifts in alignments of the countries of Southeast Asia over time?  What explains their alignment choices?  And what are the implications for Singapore, the superpowers, and the region?
