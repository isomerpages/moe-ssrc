Strengthening enterprise capabilities to innovate and scale up, and developing strong digital capabilities are two of the seven economic strategies recommended by Singapore’s Committee on the Future Economy for Singapore moving forward. 

A key factor driving individuals’ and organisations’ ability to innovate is their ability to identify new opportunities. This project aims to examine whether the ability to identify opportunities can be trained and what aspects of training are critical in building individuals’ ability to identify opportunities. This project will inform Singapore on the design of training programmes to hone entrepreneurial and innovative instincts of people.
