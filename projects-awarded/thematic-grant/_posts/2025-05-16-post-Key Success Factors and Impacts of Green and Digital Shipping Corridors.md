This project aims to evaluate the key success factors and impacts of green and digital shipping corridors (GDSCs) involving the Port of Singapore using social sciences methodologies based on big data analytics and scenario analysis. it addresses two research questions on ways to establish successful GDSCs and impacts of GDSCs.. The study will consider all corridors involving Singapore with signed initiatives, including Singapore-Rotterdam, Singapore-Los Angeles/Long Beach, Singapore-Australia, Singapore-Japan, and Singapore-Tianjin . A scenario analysis methodology will be introduced to delineate business scenarios based on future possible alternative fuel options.  
  
Overall, this project offers methodological innovations and is expected to provide reliable policy and management insights generated from shipping big data for policymakers, industry stakeholders and environmental planners seeking to mitigate maritime sector's carbon footprint. It also lays the groundwork of evaluating the climate and health impacts of shipping emissions. Additionally, the study can facilitate the construction of an industry cooperation platform that encourages participants in the cluster to work together to address cross-border challenges, coordinate infrastructure development, share knowledge, harmonize standards and attract investment along the supply chain. The practical recommendations derived from this research will help achieve greater environmental benefits at less cost, and enhance the efficiency of GDSCs as they move from initiative to implementation.
