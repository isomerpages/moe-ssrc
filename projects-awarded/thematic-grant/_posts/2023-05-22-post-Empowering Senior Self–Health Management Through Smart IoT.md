The research aims to identify the assemblages of institutions, practices and instruments required to ensure the effective and inclusive governance of Nature-based Carbon Sinks (NCS) in Southeast Asia.&nbsp; This would help to fully realise the potential of NCS in supplying climate mitigation, and its associated co-benefits without undermining key sustainable development goals.

The research project aims to (i) develop theoretical and policy linkages between human responsibilities for, and dependencies upon NCS; (ii) determine the optimal arrangements for governing NCS across a range of spatial and administrative scales; and (iii) and locate the most appropriate technologies and strategies of governance within the socio-spatial contexts and institutional cultures that shape the success or failure of particular NCS.  

Findings from this study will contribute to Singapore’s ongoing efforts to adapt and build resilience to climate change challenges.
