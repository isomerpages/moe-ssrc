This project aims to develop an evidence-based methodology for co-designing policies to guide the ethical and socially responsible implementation of new technologies in Singapore. The PI has previously developed an innovative methodology called Collective Reflective Equilibrium in Practice (CREP), which involved bringing ethical concepts, theories and principles into maximum coherence with public intuitions to form policy. CREP is innovative because it moves iteratively between multiple layers of integrated normative analyses and empirical evidence to co-produce substantive practical solutions in consultation with key stakeholders and the wider publics. This methodology will be applied to three strategic Singaporean technology initiatives: the National Precision Medicine strategy, PRISM (SingHealth Duke-NUS Institute of Precision Medicine), and Project RESET.

CREPSING aims to fill important gaps in the bioethics, social science and science policy literature with an innovative design that integrates established empirical and theoretical methodologies to develop a Singapore-specific process for co-designing practical solutions to the ethical and societal challenges of new technologies.
