Low-income binational families typically face additional challenges as a result of differential socio-economic status and social needs being brought into the marital and familial structure by local and foreign spouses. Understanding how such challenges affect the social functioning and integration of such families into Singapore is important in minimising the socio-economic vulnerabilities of these families, and better supporting their integration into Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp;

The project aims to gather information on low-income binational families to understand how the following factors contribute to these families’ social integration at both the individual and familial level:

(i) demographic conditions, such as nationality, immigration and employment status,&nbsp;

(ii) psycho-socio-economic challenges, such as marital conflict, parenting difficulties, and child adjustment issues, and&nbsp;

(iii) availability and utilisation of social capital, such as social support systems and social services.
