This project is an extension of the research project awarded in the 2018 SSRTG call to gain deeper insights on the kinds of “in-work” poverty (i.e experiencing poverty while being employed) that the young working class are experiencing. 

The project will gain a deeper and wider understanding of the lived realities of younger low-waged workers through surveys, interviews, and focus-group discussions with relevant parties such as employers, unions and government agencies.
