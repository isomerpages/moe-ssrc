As digitalisation creates new industries and transforms existing ones, there is a need to adopt digital technologies across all sectors of the economy in order to tap on the digital economy. One such technology is algorithmic pricing in which computer algorithms are used to set market prices. The use of algorithmic pricing, while providing economic gains to both businesses and consumers, has potential risks such as occurrences of tacit collusion. While recognising the existence of such risks, regulators face considerable challenges in crafting optimal rules and regulations in markets with algorithmic pricing.&nbsp;

This project will adopt a multi-disciplinary approach to undertake an in-depth study on the impact of algorithmic pricing on competition law and regulation. The findings will help enhance policymakers’ understanding of how digital technologies evolve and impact the society in Singapore.
