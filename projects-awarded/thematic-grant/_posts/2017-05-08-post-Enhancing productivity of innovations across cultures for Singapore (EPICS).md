Innovation is key to remain competitive in a fast-changing economy. To develop innovations and harness them effectively in the market, there is a need to understand how a national culture influences innovation processes at various levels such as national markets, companiesâ€™ strategies, innovation teams, and among individuals.&nbsp;

The project seeks to develop a cross-cultural theory of innovation and develop new instruments to understand cross-cultural differences from an Asia-centric perspective. These will help foster innovation productivity and enhance the international impact of Singaporean businesses. The research will be set in China, India, Indonesia, and Singapore.
