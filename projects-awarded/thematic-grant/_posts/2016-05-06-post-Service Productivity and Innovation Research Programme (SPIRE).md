SPIRE (Service Productivity and Innovation Research) responds to the national productivity challenge, particularly in service industries. The inter-disciplinary project draws scholars with diverse expertise, including data analytics, optimisation, stochastic modelling, applied microeconomics, and behavioural science.&nbsp;

SPIRE will advance new scientific knowledge in the disciplines and develop cost-effective and scalable strategies to raise productivity across multiple industries. The issues to be studied include: increasing customer use of self-service check-outs in supermarkets, optimising shared locker systems for logistics services, optimising management of car-sharing services, and improving patient flow management in healthcare services. SPIRE will collaborate with partners in the public and private sector, including the Ministry of Trade and Industry, Public Service Division, SingHealth, Eastern Health Alliance, Yamato Asia, and Sheng Siong. &nbsp;

The project aims to produce research that is relevant and impactful for both industry and policy-makers.
