The research program aims to generate substantial academic implications in order to enrich future research on sustainability and sustainable finance. So far, academic development in this domain has been limited by the challenges associated with interdisciplinary engagement in understanding sustainable ecosystems.  
  
Leveraging Sustainable and Green Finance Institute (SGFIN)’s pivotal role in bridging various disciplines surrounding sustainability, such as economics, finance, strategy, organizations, policy, sociology, and ecology, the proposed research program overcomes existing challenges with multidisciplinary approaches in understanding mechanisms and ecosystems of sustainable finance. By delving into and capitalizing on these interdisciplinary connections, the research program offers a unique opportunity to advance the theoretical and conceptual frameworks alongside the empirical methodologies necessary to develop a comprehensive ecosystem for sustainable transitions.  
  
This research on the intersection of sustainability, economy, and finance aims to develop to a more holistic understanding of how product and financial systems interact with environmental and social factors, ultimately informing more effective corporate and societal strategies for sustainable developments.
