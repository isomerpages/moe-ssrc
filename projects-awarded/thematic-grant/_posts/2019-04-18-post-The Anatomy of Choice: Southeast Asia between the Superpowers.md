The project&nbsp;seeks to trace and explain the strategic alignments − past, present, and future − of the ten ASEAN countries − in the wake of US-China geopolitical rivalry.&nbsp;As the rivalry intensifies, the uncommitted ASEAN countries will find it increasingly difficult to maintain their position of not choosing between the two superpowers. The&nbsp;project will seek to answer four key questions related to this strategic dilemma.&nbsp; What does it mean to choose (between the US and China)?&nbsp; How can we track the shifts in alignments of the countries of Southeast Asia over time?&nbsp; What explains their alignment choices?&nbsp; And what are the implications for Singapore, the superpowers, and the region?
