This project aims to examine the effects of behavioural biases on decision-making in the workplace, in the contexts of food manufacturing and personal transportation industries.

The findings will lead to a better understanding of the behavioural impediments to optimal decision-making in work contexts, higher productivity, and more effective policies. Such understanding would help decision-makers to increase productivity and help policy-makers formulate interventions that achieve the intended outcomes more effectively.
