The broad aim of this proposal is to investigate the extent and granularity of how AI, as a learning technology, changes how users approach their jobs and their attitudes and experiences of interacting with an AI agent in the performance of their work. The project will contribute to research and practice by drawing expertise from three disciplines, i.e., information technology, communications, and medicine, towards three aims:  
  
1\. Using qualitative research to investigate users’ emotions, attitudes, and experiences arising from the use of healthcare AI agents to develop a theory of acceptance or rejection of AI recommendations.  

2\. Using a mixed-method approach to validate and generalize the theory developed above considering the role played by emotions, attitudes, and experiences towards accepting or rejecting an AI collaborator’s recommendation across contexts.  

3\. Using longitudinal methods to investigate changes in emotions, attitudes, experiences, and responses as healthcare professionals become familiar with collaborating with an AI agent.
