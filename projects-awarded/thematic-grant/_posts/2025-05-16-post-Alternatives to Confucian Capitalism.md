|**Funding Type** | A |

This research project aims to develop sustainable digital archives of local historical materials, ranging from Chinese stone, wood, and metal inscriptions, to internally published commemorative volumes of temples and associations, to manuscripts of minutes of meetings of these associations, to hand-written account books and business documents of the companies and individuals that supported these institutions.  
  
A database combining the sources described in this application will enable scholars to identify leading businesses, understand their history, and assess their strategic decisions. Scholars will also be able to trace emergent&nbsp; business practices, including changes in accounting, the rise of banks and insurance companies, the rise of limited shares company to expand capital and spread risk, diversification of enterprises, industrialization and the use of new technologies, competition in transport and shipping to compete with European firms. These sources will enable the team to chart the rise and fall of businesses and different sectors of the economy and develop network diagrams showing the evolving interlocking boards of directors of temples, associations, schools, hospitals and charities, The data will allow the team to map and analyze the complex trade networks across Southeast Asia. Ultimately the project will also make a searchable, rich set of documents available that will provide primary material for future generations of historians and cultural analysts.
