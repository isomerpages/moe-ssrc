As a small, island city-state, Singapore is economically, environmentally, and politically interconnected, with regional neighbours in Southeast Asia.&nbsp; The resilience and reliability of these interconnections have facilitated economic growth, regional stability, and cordial diplomatic relations. However, development benefits in the region have not come without costs; rising living standards are associated with increasing rates of resource extraction, reduced environmental quality, and impoverishment of biodiversity that have negative ramifications for exposed population groups.&nbsp;

In light of the above challenges, this project seeks to:&nbsp;

*   First, identify the drivers and impacts associated with two major transboundary environmental challenges impacting land, water, and atmosphere in Southeast Asia i.e. biomass burning and haze, and hydropower development and water resources;&nbsp;
    

*   Second, to examine these transboundary challenges in the context of governance of transboundary environmental commons, or common pool resources, within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), as well as the identification of relevant best practices worldwide; and
    

*   Third, to develop the concept of transboundary environmental commons within ASEAN.&nbsp;&nbsp;

The project also aims to contribute to environmental sustainability within ASEAN, as well as provide an evidence-based foundation for policy-making and implementation at both national and ASEAN levels that enhances Singapore’s reputation as a responsible neighbour and a leader in sustainability sciences.
