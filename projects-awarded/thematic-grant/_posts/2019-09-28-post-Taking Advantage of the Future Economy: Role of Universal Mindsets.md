The future economy is characterized by an increased use of new technologies that keep changing over time given a rapid pace of innovation hence a workforce that is ready to learn new skills and innovate as the situation demands is needed to keep up with these constant changes.

Given the recent developments in the economy, the Singaporean workforce needs to (1) acquire skills in computer programming and data analytics, (2) shift from doing more routine work (which is likely to be automated) to more creative and innovative work (which cannot as easily be implemented by machines), and (3) be ready to acquire new skills at any point in their life as their current skills can quickly become redundant given rapid technological changes.

The project proposes to study the mindsets of the Singaporean workforce in aspects of programming, creativity and innovation and upgrading of skills through a multi-study approach.
