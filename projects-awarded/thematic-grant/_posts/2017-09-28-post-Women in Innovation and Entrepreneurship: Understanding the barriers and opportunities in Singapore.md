Under-representation of women in sectors where innovation and creativity are highly valued is evident in Singapore. This project seeks to understand women’s performance and under-representation in such sectors by focusing on the intra- and inter-personal behaviours and dynamics of women innovators and entrepreneurs in Singapore and aims to develop interventions to resolve these barriers.

While there are existing efforts made to increase women’s involvement and achievement in innovation and entrepreneurship, the insights from this project will help inform such current efforts and achieve greater gender equality in Singapore’s innovative and entrepreneurial landscape.
