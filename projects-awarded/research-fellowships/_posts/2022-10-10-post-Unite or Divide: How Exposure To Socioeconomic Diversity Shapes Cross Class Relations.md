The project examines socioeconomic diversity (SED) as a novel social context that may shape responses to social class differences. 

Through her project, Asst Prof Tan seeks to address scientific gaps in the current literature on diversity and intergroup contact. These gaps include the lack of empirical work on diversity and contact specific to social class as well as limited attempts at developing evidence-based approaches to foster positive response to SED and cross-class contact.

The findings of this Singapore-focused project have the potential to enhance our understanding of group diversity and intergroup contact. They will also provide new evidence that can inform the design of broader social interventions to improve class relations and mitigate potential problems that can affect societal sustainability arising from class divisions.
