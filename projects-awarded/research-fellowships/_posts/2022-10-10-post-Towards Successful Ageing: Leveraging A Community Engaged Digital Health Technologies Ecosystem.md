Through his project, Asst Prof Lee aims to address the overarching question: ‘What are the motivations and barriers to digital technologies adoption among future and current seniors and how can they be leveraged to encourage active ageing?’ His research also seeks to engender the development of a sustainable community engaged in the digital health technologies ecosystem by bringing together and building the capacity of stakeholders such as senior centres, community partners, as well as future and current seniors to improve their physical activity and mental well-being. 

Against the backdrop of Singapore’s rapidly ageing population, this project will create substantial value by cultivating a better understanding of the motivations for and barriers to the utilisation of digital health technologies amongst seniors as well as catalysing capacity building and partnerships within the existing network of senior activity centres across Singapore.

Insights generated from the research will also help to position Singapore as a leader in digital health technology in ASEAN and globally.
