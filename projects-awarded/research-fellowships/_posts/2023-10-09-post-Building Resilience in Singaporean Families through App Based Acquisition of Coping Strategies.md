The project seeks to understand the coping mechanisms that Singaporean parents and children employ with the aim of developing an evidence-based mobile application intervention to equip parents with coping strategies in managing everyday challenges at work and at home. 

Through her project, Dr Atiqah examines the neuroscientific mechanisms underpinning dyadic coping and stress mitigation within parent-child dyads. She hopes to do so by ascertaining the coping techniques used by Singaporean parents to mitigate stress from work and home sources as well as coping techniques amongst a preschool-age population and their propensity for fortifying resilience at this early age. A mobile application which adopts a micro-learning approach will be subsequently developed and piloted to help provide parents with coping strategies in managing everyday challenges. 

Findings from the project have the potential to address the pressing mental health needs in Singapore. Once developed and implemented, the evidence-based mobile application can directly benefit the community in enhancing resilience amongst families in Singapore.
