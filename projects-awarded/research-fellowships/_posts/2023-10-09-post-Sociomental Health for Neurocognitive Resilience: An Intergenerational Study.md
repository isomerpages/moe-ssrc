The project seeks to understand how mid-life psychological and social risk factors are associated with neuroimaging and neuropsychological measures of the brain and longitudinal cognitive health. It also aims to ascertain the role of familial relationships as a buffering factor against age-related neurocognitive decline. 

Through his project, Asst Prof Tan hopes to provide a holistic understanding of both non-biological and biological contributors to neurocognitive health in mid-life. This will be attained by:

*  Evaluating the associations of sociomental health with neuroimaging markers of brain health and cognitive function;
*  Evaluating the state of dementia knowledge and attitudes in young adults and the buffering effects of family relations; and 
*  Developing longitudinal prediction of cognitive decline based on its associations to sociomental health and brain health. 

Findings from the project can help advance Singapore towards a sustainable and preventive healthcare system against age-related neurocognitive decline. The intergeneration recruitment strategy adopted for the project will also set a strong foundation for a family-up approach towards normalising conversations and detection of early signs of cognitive symptoms of dementia within families.
