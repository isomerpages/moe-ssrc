This study will use Virtual Reality (VR) to test theoretical models of fostering more positive outgroup attitudes based on Construal Level Theory (CLT), and augmented by the Common Ingroup Identity Model (CIIM).  

Through a series of experimental studies, the research aims to validate the efficacy of VR technologies in improving attitudes between in/outgroups, as well as develop and test a theoretical model of VR effects. This will be explored through the context of improving attitudes among young Singaporeans (ingroup) towards older adults (outgroup).  

With VR devices becoming more affordable with better quality, and more engaging VR content being developed, these insights are timely in providing an understanding of how VR can be harnessed for positive social impact.
