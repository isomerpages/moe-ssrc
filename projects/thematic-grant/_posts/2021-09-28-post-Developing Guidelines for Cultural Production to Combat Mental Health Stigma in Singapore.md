This study aims to address the problem of mental health stigma by analysing how cultural texts (films, television dramas, novels and plays) present mental health, and develop guidelines for writers, directors and producers.  

The research team will approach this issue through the lens of Medical Humanities and analyse texts using close reading techniques, including narrative voice, camera angle, use of metaphor, etc.  

The guidelines developed will result in more positive and accurate representations of mental health, and help to challenge the preconceptions and stereotypes that lead to the stigmatisation of vulnerable members of society
