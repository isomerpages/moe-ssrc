An ageing population has profound impact on society and economy, such as rising healthcare costs and decreasing economic productivity. The effective harnessing of information technology can potentially alleviate these two pressing issues.

This project will partner Ng Teng Fong General Hospital and Jurong Community Hospital to examine the effective use of electronic medical records (EMR) system in Singapore. The project will study how clinical users use EMR data to inform their decision making, provide findings on how predictive models can be developed through text-mining of EMR data to predict onset of ailments and shape the coordination of workflow, and how analytics can be integrated into the complex healthcare workflow. The insights from this project can potentially raise the productivity of healthcare services in Singapore.
