The study aims to investigate demographic, socio-cultural, psychological and process-related factors which influence individualsâ€™ commitment to volunteering as Community First Responders.  

Informed by functional theory and social capital theory, the study will advance the conceptual understanding of motivations for volunteering in emergency services.  

Findings of this study will also be useful in informing the design initiatives and programmes that aim to enhance citizen engagement in the community.
