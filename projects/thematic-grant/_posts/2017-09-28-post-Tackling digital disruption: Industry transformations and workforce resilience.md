In the face of rapid digital advancement, there is a need to understand how technology is transforming work and industries, and how governments and businesses tackle this disruption.

This project seeks to examine the impact of digital disruption on work in the manufacturing, and finance and banking sectors, and understand how organisations and workers can adopt, adapt, and master these technologies to increase productivity. As Singapore moves towards being a Smart Nation, the insights from this project can potentially inform Singapore on the tracking of the impact of digital disruption and capitalise on such disruptions to create new jobs.
