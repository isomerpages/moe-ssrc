Social media’s tremendous growth has resulted in the availability of digital data which can provide meaningful insights to social media users’ preferences and decision making styles. 

This project aims to show how analysing such digital data can be used to predict social media users’ decision making styles. The insights from this project will inform Singapore on how data analytics can be effectively used to provide evidence-based inferences about individual and community characteristics to better inform government policies and businesses.
