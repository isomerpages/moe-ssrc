New start-ups generally face challenges such as recruitment and resource procurement due to the lack of a “track record”. This situation is exacerbated for Singapore start-ups looking to venture to overseas markets. In addition to the lack of social and financial capital, these start-ups may lack a sufficient understanding of the overseas regulatory framework.

This project seeks to address the challenges faced by local start-ups and provide insights on the behavioural changes and strategic initiatives that local entrepreneurs can introduce in their business model to increase their success rate. A customised training and support programme will be developed to support the entrepreneurs and their start-ups.
