The research project will investigate financial literacy and financial capabilities in Singapore, and provide evidence-based analyses of how financial knowledge influences economic-decision making, with particular emphasis on financial behaviours relating to retirement.    

The research design will innovatively define the skillsets individuals may rely on to make good retirement-related decisions by including additional dimensions on financial literacy, such as investor knowledge and longevity, to understand retirement financial behaviour. The research will also take into account contextual circumstances such as the mandatory participation and annuitization in Singapore’s Central Provident Fund (CPF scheme).
