This project aims to develop an integrated database of semantic, affective, and word association norms for a large set of Singapore English words.

The project aims to collect semantic-affective norms and word association norms for ~5,000 commonly used standard Singapore English words, and ~3,000 uniquely Singapore English words. These language norms will be obtained from Singaporeans to develop the first psychological language databases of English words that reflect local, culturally-specific meanings, as reflected in the Singaporean mental lexicon.

Findings from this research will provide a locally normed language database which can be used to augment Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches to sentiment analysis and emotional profiling.
