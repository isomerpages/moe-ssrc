#### **About the Social Science Research Council**
As Singapore progresses and matures as a nation, the social sciences and humanities are increasingly important to enrich understanding of our society and issues such as ageing, social mobility, cultural diversity, quality of life, and regional and global challenges that affect Singapore. The Social Science Research Council (SSRC) was set up in January 2016 to provide concerted direction and support for social science and humanities research. The SSRC will serve as a focal point for efforts to develop talent and strengthen social science and humanities research that benefits social and economic development in Singapore and the Asian region.  
  
The SSRC comprises prominent local social science and humanities academics and policymakers, and is responsible for the following:  

*   To promote and support social science and humanities research that is relevant to Singapore and other societies, particularly in Asia; and

*   To develop capabilities and partnerships, and nurture human capital to strengthen the social science and humanities research ecosystem in Singapore.
