The Social Science Research Thematic Grant (SSRTG) Engagement Session is organised to provide social science and humanities research from local universities and research institutes further information of the SSRTG following the launch of the annual grant call.  
  
As part of the session, there is a panel discussion chaired by SSRC chairman, where SSRC members are invited to share their feedback on the proposals submitted in the 2018 grant call. There is also time allocated for a Q&A session between the SSRC members and the researchers.
