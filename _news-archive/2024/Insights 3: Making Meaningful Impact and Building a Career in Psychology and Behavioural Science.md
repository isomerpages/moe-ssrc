<p>The third&nbsp;<em>Insights from the Inside</em>&nbsp;engagement session
was delivered by Professor David Chan, Lee Kong Chian Professor of Psychology
and Director of the Behavioural Sciences Initiative at Singapore Management
University, on 29 October 2024, and attended by faculty from NUS, NTU,
SMU, SUTD, and SUSS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prof Chan shared his personal career journey first as a police officer
and subsequently in academia, and how practical life experiences have shaped
his worldviews and belief in a scientist-practitioner model approach to
issues in research, practice and public policy.&nbsp;He also offered advice
on effective collaborations with public agencies, stressing the importance
of professional engagements, social interactions and networks, and building
trust in competence, integrity and benevolence as they relate to oneâ€™s
credibility with the research community, agencies and the public.&nbsp;</p>
