was delivered on 12 March 2025 by Professor Euston Quah, Albert Winsemius
Chair Professor of Economics at NTU and Director of the Economic Growth
Centre.</p>
<p>Attended by faculty from NUS, NTU, SUTD, and SUSS,&nbsp;Prof Quah shared
his personal journey starting out as an academic in the 1980s and advised
junior faculty to be curious, ask questions and take advantage of networking
opportunities to make and sustain connections over time. Prof Quah also
stressed that applied research is as important as theoretical work and
noted the increased emphasis on applied work in the research funding landscape
today.</p>
