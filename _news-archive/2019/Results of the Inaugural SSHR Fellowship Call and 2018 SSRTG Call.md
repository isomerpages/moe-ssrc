Explaining the importance of the SSHR Fellowship, Chairman of the SSRC, Mr Peter Ho, said: “It remains a priority for the Council to build up the social science and humanities research ecosystem in Singapore, and cultivate an appreciation for its value in addressing issues of strategic relevance to Singapore and the region. The new SSHR Fellowship is an important SSRC initiative to support creative young local social science and humanities researchers. The awardees have established themselves as promising social scientists and humanists. I am encouraged by their good academic work and their commitment to delivering positive impact for our society.”
